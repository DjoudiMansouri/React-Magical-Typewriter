function App() {
  return (
    <div className="app">
      <h1>

          typingSpeed={100}

## üìö Animation Styles


### Built-in Animation Styles:

#### Elegant

Clean, simple fade-in animation that looks professional.

```jsx
 <ReactMagicalTypewriter text="Hello World" animationStyle="Elegant" />
```

#### Whimsical

Playful, bouncy animations with randomized movements and rotations.

```jsx
 <ReactMagicalTypewriter text="Hello World" animationStyle="Whimsical" />
```

#### Landing

Characters drop in from above with a slight elastic bounce.

```jsx
 <ReactMagicalTypewriter text="Hello World" animationStyle="Landing" />
```

#### Arise

Characters rise from below with a smooth, powerful motion.

```jsx
 <ReactMagicalTypewriter text="Hello World" animationStyle="Arise" />
```

#### Rift

Characters appear with a dramatic spinning and scaling effect, as if from a dimensional rift.

```jsx
 <ReactMagicalTypewriter text="Hello World" animationStyle="Rift" />
```

#### Warp

Characters stretch in horizontally with an elastic, warp-like effect.

```jsx
 <ReactMagicalTypewriter text="Hello World" animationStyle="Warp" />
```

---
üÜï **New Animation Styles:**
---

#### RadialBurst

Each character explodes into view with radiating light rays before settling into place.

```jsx
 <ReactMagicalTypewriter text="Hello World" animationStyle="RadialBurst" />
```

#### LiquidDrip

Characters "drip" into place from above, like fluid ink, with a slight stretch and settle.

```jsx
 <ReactMagicalTypewriter text="Hello World" animationStyle="LiquidDrip" />
```

#### LaserSketch

Characters are "drawn" or "sketched" in diagonally by an imaginary laser, followed by a quick flash.

```jsx
 <ReactMagicalTypewriter text="Hello World" animationStyle="LaserSketch" />
```

#### FlipReveal

Characters flip into view with a 3D rotation around the Y-axis, as if turning over a card.

```jsx
 <ReactMagicalTypewriter text="Hello World" animationStyle="FlipReveal" />
```

#### PixelGlitch

Characters initially appear pixelated, blurry, and skewed, then quickly resolve into a clear state.

```jsx
 <ReactMagicalTypewriter text="Hello World" animationStyle="PixelGlitch" />
```

#### GhostTrail

Each character appears quickly, leaving a faint, fading echo or "ghost" trailing behind it.

```jsx
 <ReactMagicalTypewriter text="Hello World" animationStyle="GhostTrail" />
```

#### ShatterIn

Characters form as small, scattered fragments quickly converge and assemble into the final letter.

```jsx
 <ReactMagicalTypewriter text="Hello World" animationStyle="ShatterIn" />
```

#### OrigamiReveal

Characters unfold into place as if made of paper, with skews and scaling that mimic an origami reveal.

```jsx
 <ReactMagicalTypewriter text="Hello World" animationStyle="OrigamiReveal" />
```


I've tried to make the descriptions concise and evocative, matching the style of your existing documentation. I've also added placeholder JSX examples, assuming they would be used similarly.

### Custom Animations

Create your own animations using GSAP properties:

```jsx
<ReactMagicalTypewriter 
  text="Completely custom animations!"
  animationStyle={{
    from: { 
      opacity: 0, 
      scale: 3, 
      rotation: 180, 
      y: -50,
      color: "#ff0000"
    },
    to: { 
      opacity: 1, 
      scale: 1, 
      rotation: 0, 
      y: 0,
      color: "#000000" 
    },
    duration: 0.8,
    ease: "elastic.out(1.2, 0.5)"
  }}
/>
```

## üéØ Advanced Examples

### Use it with different elements

```jsx
<div>
  <h1>
    <ReactMagicalTypewriter text="Large Heading" animationStyle="Landing" />
  </h1>
  
  <p>
    <ReactMagicalTypewriter 
      text="This is paragraph text that will be typed out character by character." 
      typingSpeed={50} 
      animationStyle="Elegant" 
    />
  </p>
  
  <button>
    <ReactMagicalTypewriter text="Click Me!" animationStyle="Rift" />
  </button>
</div>
```

### Sequence multiple typewriters with callbacks

```jsx
function SequencedTypewriters() {
  const [showSecond, setShowSecond] = useState(false);
  const [showThird, setShowThird] = useState(false);
  
  return (
    <div>
      <h2>
        <ReactMagicalTypewriter 
          text="First, this text appears..." 
          typingSpeed={80}
          onComplete={() => setShowSecond(true)}
        />
      </h2>
      
      {showSecond && (
        <h3>
          <ReactMagicalTypewriter 
            text="Then this second line starts typing..." 
            typingSpeed={80}
            animationStyle="Arise"
            onComplete={() => setShowThird(true)}
          />
        </h3>
      )}
      
      {showThird && (
        <p>
          <ReactMagicalTypewriter 
            text="And finally, we complete the sequence!" 
            typingSpeed={80}
            animationStyle="Whimsical"
          />
        </p>
      )}
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Custom cursor styling

```jsx
<ReactMagicalTypewriter 
  text="Look at this custom cursor"
  cursorCharacter="‚ñå"
  cursorBlinkSpeed={300}
  cursorInvert="vertical"
/>
```

### Combined with other animations

```jsx
function FadeInTypewriter() {
  const containerRef = useRef(null);
  
  useEffect(() => {
    gsap.fromTo(
      containerRef.current,
      { opacity: 0, y: 30 },
      { opacity: 1, y: 0, duration: 1, ease: "power3.out" }
    );
  }, []);
  
  return (
    <div ref={containerRef} className="container">
      <ReactMagicalTypewriter 
        text="This entire container fades in, then the text types out!"
        typingSpeed={100}
      />
    </div>
  );
}
```

## ü™Ñ CSS Styling

The component uses inline-block span elements, making it easy to style with CSS and TailwindCSS:

```jsx
<ReactMagicalTypewriter 
  text="Custom styled text" 
  className="my-custom-typewriter"
/>
```

```css
.my-custom-typewriter {
  font-family: 'Courier New', monospace;
  font-size: 2rem;
  color: #8a2be2;
  text-shadow: 2px 2px 4px rgba(0,0,0,0.3);
}
```

If you need to reproduce the clipping effects for Landing and Arise animations, i suggest you add these styles: 

On TailwindCSS : 

```jsx
"[clip-path:polygon(0_-5%,100%_-5%,100%_105%,0%_105%)]"
```

On pure CSS : 

```jsx
.clippedText {
  clip-path: polygon(0 -5%, 100% -5%, 100% 105%, 0% 105%);
}
```

## üîÑ TypeScript Type Definitions

```typescript
import { ReactMagicalTypewriter, PredefinedAnimationStyle, CustomAnimation } from 'react-magical-typewriter';

// Using with TypeScript
const MyComponent: React.FC = () => {
  // Type-safe animation style
  const animStyle: PredefinedAnimationStyle = "Whimsical";
  
  // Type-safe custom animation
  const customAnim: CustomAnimation = {
    from: { opacity: 0, y: -20 },
    to: { opacity: 1, y: 0 },
    duration: 0.5,
    ease: "power2.out"
  };
  
  return (
    <div>
      <ReactMagicalTypewriter text="Type-safe typewriter!" animationStyle={animStyle} />
      <ReactMagicalTypewriter text="Custom animations too!" animationStyle={customAnim} />
    </div>
  );
};
```
